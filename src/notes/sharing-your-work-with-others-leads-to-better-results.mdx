- Great ideas must be written down to be interpreted by others. This is the purpose of and where Product Proposals Write-Up shine in their ability to get buy-in and common understanding. People can't crawl into your head and extract your thoughts, so you have to share and give them the same **context that you had** when you were developing your ideas.
- You must invite the criticism of your peers. If you do this too late, your ideas will be too weak to stand up to inevitable adversities that will come later. Ideas are meant to be pressure tested and you shouldn't become too attached to them. If new information feels like a threat, then something is wrong with your research process.
