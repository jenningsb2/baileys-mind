- Customers opinions on whether or not the 'like' or 'dislike' our product is meaningless. We are not trying to get our customers to like us or our product, we are trying to solve their problems. To do that we need to unearth the context surrounding their requests. [[Zettle/You must dig]]
- Discovery is not the time to be pitching ideas or getting feedback on designs it is the time for building your customers profiles and giving you more understanding so **you** can decide "Whats in and whats out."
  - This is the time to understand what **matters** to you customer, which helps guide what you build. You are not asking them directly to tell you because [[Zettle/Products should not be built by a committee]]
